1. Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming?
=> Python is one of the most popular programming language due to its following features
    1. Simple and readable syntax
    2. Dynamically typed language so need to declare data type of variable.
    3. Large number of library build for various tasks.
    4. Large community support.
    5. Open source and free to use.
    6. Supports object oriented programming.

2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a  program?
=> Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning. They are used to define the syntax and structure of Python programs and cannot be used as variable names.

    # example

    def func1(*args): # def is user for function defination
        n=[]
        for i in args: # for is used for loop the iterables
                if type(i) == list:    # if is used for checking conditions in program
                        n.append(i)
        return n # return is used to return a value from function

    a = func1(1,2,[1,2], 3)
    print(a) # print is used for displaying message or print message on screen or terminal

3. Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples?
=> Mutable object:
    1. Mutable object are object that can be changed after its creation
    2. list, dict are examples of mutable object
    3. example
        myList = [1.2,3,5,"Abhi", (3+6j), [1,2.3]]
        myList.append('5')
        print(myList) # [1.2,3,5,"Abhi", (3+6j), [1,2.3], 5]
    
   Inmutable object:
    1. Inmutable object are object that can not be changed after its creation
    2. Tupel, str are example of Inmutable object
    3. When we try to change this object Python give error as they acts constant

4. Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used?
=> following are types of operators in Python
    1. Arithmetic operators
        e.g: a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b
    2. Comparison operators
        e.g: a == b, a < b, a > b
    3. Assignment operators
        e.g: a = b, a += b, a -= b
    4. Logical operators
        e.g: a == b and c != d
    5. Membership operators
        e.g: a in 'Abhi' # return True
    6. Identity operators
        e.g: a is b, a is not b
        
5. Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples?
=> Type casting means converting a value from one data type to other
    e.g:  a = '10'
          b = int(a) # It convert data type of a (str) string to (int) integer

6. How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples
=> Conditional statements are used to make decisions in Python programs based on certain conditions.
    e.g: userInput=input("Enter a number: ")

        if userInput.isdigit():
            num=int(userInput)
            print("You have enter a valid number")
        else:
            print("Please enter a valid number")    
        # In this example if user enter a valid input we will execute code block of if other wise we will execute else code block

7. Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples?
=> Loops are used to iterate over an object to perform a same action on each element of iterables of run a block of code until exit with condition
    1. For loop: It is user to iterate over a sequence like list, tupel, string
        e.g. myData = [(1,2), (3, 4)]

             for x, y in myData:
               print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}") # this will print value of x and y in until all element of myData is iterated
               x: 1, y: 2
               x: 3, y: 4

    2. While loop: This loop run until the condition is true and once condition in false it exit the loop
        e.g. maxStar=5
             row=1
             
             while row <= maxStar:
                col=1
                while col <= row:
                    print('*', end='')
                    col += 1
                print()
                row += 1
            # this will print the star pattern and run until row value is less than equal to 5
